## üõ†Ô∏è Problems It Solves
1. **Unity ETC/ETC2 Compression Issues**  
   Unity requires textures to have dimensions multiple of 4. Non-compliant images (e.g., 511√ó512) break builds.  
   ‚úÖ PixelForge automatically aligns textures to multiples of 4.

2. **Google Play Store Asset Rejections**  
   Google Play requires exact sizes: icons (512√ó512), screenshots (1920√ó1080 or 1080√ó1920).  
   Designer-provided assets often come as 511√ó512 or 1920√ó1081.  
   ‚úÖ PixelForge fixes these off-by-1 errors instantly.

3. **Batch Processing**  
   Fix hundreds of images at once, saving hours of manual work.

4. **Quality Preservation**  
   Uses **Lanczos resampling**, keeps **EXIF orientation**, supports many formats.
